    "# Fetal Brain Tractography Pipeline Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through a pipeline for generating tractography in fetal brains using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The pipeline covers several steps: from converting the tensor to an Orientation Distribution Function (ODF), to adjusting parcellations, creating a 5-tissue type (5TT) image, and generating tractography for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the diffusion tensor image to an Orientation Distribution Function (ODF).\n",
    "2. Use a tissue segmentation image and a parcellation image to create necessary brain masks and adjust parcellations.\n",
    "3. Generate a 5-tissue type (5TT) image from the tissue segmentation.\n",
    "4. Adjust the parcellation to ensure white matter regions match the tissue segmentation.\n",
    "5. Separate gray and white matter regions for tractography extraction.\n",
    "6. Generate the gray matter-white matter interface (GMWMI) for tractography seeding.\n",
    "7. Use the whole brain mask to set tract length constraints.\n",
    "8. Generate tractography using the ODF, GMWMI, and the 5TT image.\n",
    "9. Convert the tractography to a format compatible with tract extraction.\n",
    "10. Extract specific tracts from the tractography.\n"

    "If you want to extract brain structures from a segmentation/parcellation image, you can use the extract_individual_labels function. This function extracts individual labels from a segmentation image creating a binary mask for each label. This mask can then be used to visualize the brain structures in 3D or can be used as seeds for tractography. A .csv file with the mapping between the label values and the structure names is required. Here we use the labels.csv file to map the label values to the structure names."
